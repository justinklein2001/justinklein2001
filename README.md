## RECRUITERS/NON-TECHNICAL PEOPLE
Hello! Thanks for checking out my GitHub. If code scares you, don't worry! 
- All my pinned repos have easy-to-understand README docs with visual aids.
- Each of these pinned repos also has a Project (JIRA) board with all the tickets I've worked on to get each project across the finish line.

**Please feel free to snoop - I'd like you to see that I write code AND document it well!**
